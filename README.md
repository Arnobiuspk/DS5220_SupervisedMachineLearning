Overview:
•	CIFAR-10 Dataset for image classification was used to classify different objects in images.

For this project below models were used for prediction:
•	Logistic Regression.
•	Deep neural Networks with Convolution layer.

Results:
•	Logistic regression was considerably faster to train but it had only 41.75 percent accuracy.
•	DNN with Convolution layer training was seven times slower than the Logistic regression model but it had a 75 percent accuracy in its predictions.
